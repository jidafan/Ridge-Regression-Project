### Introduction

The project shown is the final project for STA315, Advanced Statistical Learning. In which, students had to select a paper, create a presentation, write a report and code an example from the paper. The paper that I selected was "Generalized Cross Validation as a method for choosing a good ridge parameter".

### Code

The [code](https://github.com/jidafan/Ridge-Regression-Project/blob/main/STA315%20Final%20Project%20Code.R) shows the inefficiencies of various methods for generating a ridge parameter. A 21 x 10 matrix is generated with various values and 100 monte carlo simulations are run. The methods that are being compared are: Generalized Cross Validation, Range Risk, Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and Allen's Press.
